### I have integrated some parameter tests

Can be launched by executing the following commands and then there is the test class ... I implemented according to a TDD logic, starting from the verification cases.

The logic was designed on the basis of the examples provided in the README

- mvn -Dtest=CoinChangeParamTest test
- mvn -Dtest=CoinChangeTest test

In addition to running it with mvn exec:java, you can also run it with mvn exec:exec

-mvn exec:exec -Dexec.executable="java" -Dexec.args="-classpath %classpath chainTest.demo.main.DemoMainClass"

integrated into the pom xml there are also some arguments passed to a main class
then just execute this in the command line : mvn clean install

### I have integrated some document about covarage
 document is present in : resource folder : 
 - src/main/resources/..
